# Ichi

*Ichi (ä¸€)* means "one" in Japanese, representing this project to unify conversational AI across Apple platforms. One of the personal aim was to create a Japanese tutor to learn basics of the language for my trip to Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan.

## Overview

Ichi is an experimental project that explores conversational AI capabilities across iOS, macOS, and visionOS. The project's name is inspired by a Japanese women I met at a conference, who got back the spark into coding again.

Last September, using online providers for speech-to-speech was expensive, and I wanted to take the on-device route instead. Local LLMs are still not there *yet*, but one day.

## Features

- Conversational AI powered by on-device LLMs
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- Onboarding process with download options for both Qwen model and Kokoro TTS voice model
