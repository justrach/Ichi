# Ichi

*Ichi (ä¸€)* means "one" in Japanese, representing this project to unify conversational AI across Apple platforms. One of the personal aim was to create a Japanese tutor to learn basics of the language for my trip to Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. 

> Local LLMs are still not there *yet*, but one day.
